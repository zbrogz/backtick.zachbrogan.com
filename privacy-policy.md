# Backtick Privacy Policy

The Backtick Chrome extension handles all user data securely and privately.

## Data Handling

The following user data is handled by the extension:

-   Google Account Id
-   Google OAuth 2.0 tokens
-   Google Doc contents, including any personal or sensitive information in the document
-   User preferences for text color and highlight color

Because the data is handled only by client-side code and integration with Google APIs, the extension developer does not have the ability to collect any user data. The extension does not transmit any data to servers accessible by the developer or any other third parties beyond those in the [Third Parties](#third-parties) section of this privacy policy.

## Data Storage

Your Google OAuth 2.0 tokens and user preferences for text color and highlight color are stored locally on your machine via the Chrome Identity and Storage APIs, respectively. Your Google Account Ids and Google Doc contents are stored by Google. See the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information. None of the user data handled by the extension is accessible for collection by the extension developer.

## Third Parties

The extension only communicates directly with the Google Docs APIs as well as the Identity and Chrome Storage APIs. No other third parties are involved. The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Chrome Web Store User Data Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/), including the [Limited Use requirements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/#limited_use).

## Secure Transmission

All data transmission by the extension is done securely over HTTPS.

## Revoking Access

To revoke access to your data from the Backtick Chrome extension, uninstall the extension from Chrome and visit <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions> to confirm.
